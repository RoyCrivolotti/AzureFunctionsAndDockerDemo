# ServerlessAppWithDocker

This app is basically composed of HTTP triggered Azure function. The different methods are hit by the URL defined inside the `Route` string.

A static list contains some dummy data to be used for the demo. The purpose was just to see what Azure Functions are and how to use them as well as to learn how to connect multiple containers, so this was enough..A step further would be to connect this Azure Functions app to another container with a database, I guess.
